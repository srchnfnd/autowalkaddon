AutoWalk Addon - README
========================

Overview
--------
AutoWalk Addon is an enhanced version of Mor's AutoWalk mod for Fallout 4.

It adds support for **automated walking to Pip-Boy Custom Destinations**. Simply place a marker on your map and press the hotkey — your character will begin walking there automatically.

New Features
------------
- Custom Destination support — walk to any user-placed map marker
- Combat-state fix — resolves the original mod's freeze/lock-up when walking triggered too soon after combat

Known Issues
------------
These are inherited from the original AutoWalk mod and are still unresolved:
- The player can get stuck on obstacles
- The player may move erratically ("crazy dancing") when walking in 3rd person view
- The player cannot open doors in 3rd person view

Unsupported Worldspaces
------------------------
Auto walking is currently not supported in "interior" or sub-worldspaces like:
- Diamond City
- Goodneighbor

Requirements
------------
These mods must be installed for AutoWalk Redux to function:
- SUP_F4SE: Used to retrieve Custom Destination coordinates
- Garden of Eden 2: Used to scan placed map markers
- TextInputMenu: Used for development tools and placing user markers

Recommended Mods
----------------
These mods enhance accuracy and immersion:
- Cartographer's Map Markers: Adds more static map markers, improving terrain accuracy
- Survivalist's Bus: A mobile shelter you can travel to and rest in

Credits
-------
- Original Mod: Auto Walk by Mor
- Script Polish & Documentation Support: ChatGPT
